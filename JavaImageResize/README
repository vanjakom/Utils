Usage:

I plan to use this utility in following scenario. Offten I need to resize pictures I want to send to people, so I'd like to find picture in File Manager right click on it and resize it to some default folder. I will use it on Ubuntu but it can be used on Mac and Windows too.



Requirements:

This project is based on http://code.google.com/p/thumbnailator/ Thumbnailer service.

I use maven as build system so you need to download Thumbailer JAR from website and install it via:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=thumbnailator-0.3.10.jar -DgroupId=net.coobird -DartifactId=thumbnailator -Dversion=0.3.10 -Dpackaging=jar

Also, change version number to your downloaded version.
