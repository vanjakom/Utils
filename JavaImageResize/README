Usage:

I plan to use this utility in following scenario. Offten I need to resize pictures I want to send to people, so I'd like to find picture in File Manager right click on it and resize it to some default folder. I will use it on Ubuntu but it can be used on Mac and Windows too.

So, to setup all. Choose some jpg picture, right click, select Open With, Other application… Choose custom command. Enter path to sh script given in bin/image_resize.sh folder of JavaImagerResize.
After that, edit bin/image_resize.sh to reflect your paths.

Requirements:

This project is based on http://code.google.com/p/thumbnailator/ Thumbnailer service.

I use maven as build system so you need to download Thumbailer JAR from website and install it via:

mvn install:install-file -Dfile=thumbnailator-0.3.10.jar -DgroupId=net.coobird -DartifactId=thumbnailator -Dversion=0.3.10 -Dpackaging=jar

Also, change version number to your downloaded version.
